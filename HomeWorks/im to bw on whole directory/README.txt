Its about,how can someone make or save the black and white version of the all images present in a directory of a specific
file format.

using this program,all the images which are present in the given directory will convert into black and white version
of them,then program will create a new directory called "outdir" and save the black and white version of original
images in there.

someone just have to clone the repository and update the all paths of the program with their paths and thats it,program
is ready now to do the work.
