Its about,how can someone perform face detection on an image using the vision library in MATLAB.

using this program,someone can easily detect faces that are present in the input image and then program will automatically
crop faces into different veriables then it will create a single output file in the newly created "outdir" directly
which contains the all faces present in the input image.

someone just have to clone the repository and run the program in the same directory.
