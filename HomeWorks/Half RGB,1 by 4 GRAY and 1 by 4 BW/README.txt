Its about,how an image can be divided into different part and how can we apply different actions on different parts of
that image.

using this program,the image that is present in the same directory will divide into three parts,one major part 1/2
become RGB just like before, other 1/4 part of image will become grayscale and other 1/4 part of that image will become
balck and white.

someone just have to clone the repository and run the program in the same directory.
