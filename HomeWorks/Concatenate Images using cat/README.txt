Its about,how to concatenate the all images of a specific file format in the directory.

using this program,all the images present in the given directory of the specific file format will concatenate with
eachothe in a single image(using the 'cat' function of the image processing toolkit of MATLAB), and then program will
display the concatenated single image in figure 1,and montage view of the concatenated image in figure 2.

someone just have to clone the repository and update the all paths of the program with their paths and thats it,program
is ready now to do the work.
