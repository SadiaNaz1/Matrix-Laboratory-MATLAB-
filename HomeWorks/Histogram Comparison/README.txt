Its about,how to calculate the difference of an image from another using histogram.

using this program,all the images of (specific file format) that are present in the directory will automatically be picked
for the operation,very first image will become qurry image for others and program will calculate the differences of
all images from qurry image and shows the differences with images along with their histograms in figure 1.

someone just have to clone the repository and update the all paths of the program with their paths and thats it,program
is ready now to do the work.
